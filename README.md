Advent of Code 2024
===================

These are my notes about solving the programming puzzles in [Advent of Code 2024](https://adventofcode.com/2024).

This time giving a try to [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/) programming language.

Had been practicing a bit during the year on exercises from 2015, so I got some helper functions ready. On the other
hand, Rust is not my everyday language, so my skills in it is a bit _rusty_ (not sure if pun intended).

Day 1
=====

Part 1
------

Quite simple stuff. Parse, then order the lists. Subtract the items, take an absolute value. Sum them all and voila!


Part 2
------

Process one list, counting the matching items in another. Multiply and sum them all.

Could made a little refactoring as there's some code repetition in solution for Part 2, but it is simple enough anyway.

Could come back and polish it some more, when in the mood.
